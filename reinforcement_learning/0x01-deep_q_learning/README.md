## Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

* What is Deep Q-learning?
* What is the policy network?
* What is replay memory?
* What is the target network?
* Why must we utilize two separate networks during training?
* What is keras-rl? How do you use it?

## Tasks
List of tasks with brief descriptions of each task.

### [0. Breakout](https://github.com/BenDoschGit/holbertonschool-machine_learning/blob/main/reinforcement_learning/0x01-deep_q_learning "0. Breakout")

Write python scripts train.py and play.py that utilizes keras, keras-rl, and gym to train an agent that can play Atariâ€™s Breakout, save and load the final policy network, and display a game played by the agent.
