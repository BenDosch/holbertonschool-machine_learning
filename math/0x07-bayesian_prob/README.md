* What is Bayesian Probability?
* What is Bayesâ€™ rule and how do you use it?
* What is a base rate?
* What is a prior?
* What is a posterior?
* What is a likelihood?

## Tasks
List of tasks with brief descriptions of each task.

### [0. Likelihood](https://github.com/BenDoschGit/holbertonschool-machine_learning/blob/main/math/0x07-bayesian_prob/0-likelihood.py "0. Likelihood")

You are conducting a study on a revolutionary cancer drug and are looking to find the probability that a patient who takes this drug will develop severe side effects. During your trials, n patients take the drug and x patients develop severe side effects. You can assume that x follows a binomial distribution.

Write a function def likelihood(x, n, P): that calculates the likelihood of obtaining this data given various hypothetical probabilities of developing severe side effects:

* x is the number of patients that develop severe side effects
* n is the total number of patients observed
* P is a 1D numpy.ndarray containing the various hypothetical probabilities of developing severe side effects
* If n is not a positive integer, raise a ValueError with the message n must be a positive integer
* If x is not an integer that is greater than or equal to 0, raise a ValueError with the message x must be an integer that is greater than or equal to 0
* If x is greater than n, raise a ValueError with the message x cannot be greater than n
* If P is not a 1D numpy.ndarray, raise a TypeError with the message P must be a 1D numpy.ndarray
* If any value in P is not in the range [0, 1], raise a ValueError with the message All values in P must be in the range [0, 1]
* Returns: a 1D numpy.ndarray containing the likelihood of obtaining the data, x and n, for each probability in P, respectively

### [1. Intersection](https://github.com/BenDoschGit/holbertonschool-machine_learning/blob/main/math/0x07-bayesian_prob/1-intersection.py "1. Intersection")

Based on 0-likelihood.py, write a function def intersection(x, n, P, Pr): that calculates the intersection of obtaining this data with the various hypothetical probabilities:

* x is the number of patients that develop severe side effects
* n is the total number of patients observed
* P is a 1D numpy.ndarray containing the various hypothetical probabilities of developing severe side effects
* Pr is a 1D numpy.ndarray containing the prior beliefs of P
* If n is not a positive integer, raise a ValueError with the message n must be a positive integer
* If x is not an integer that is greater than or equal to 0, raise a ValueError with the message x must be an integer that is greater than or equal to 0
* If x is greater than n, raise a ValueError with the message x cannot be greater than n
* If P is not a 1D numpy.ndarray, raise a TypeError with the message P must be a 1D numpy.ndarray
* If Pr is not a numpy.ndarray with the same shape as P, raise a TypeError with the message Pr must be a numpy.ndarray with the same shape as P
* If any value in P or Pr is not in the range [0, 1], raise a ValueError with the message All values in {P} must be in the range [0, 1] where {P} is the incorrect variable
* If Pr does not sum to 1, raise a ValueError with the message Pr must sum to 1 Hint: use numpy.isclose
* All exceptions should be raised in the above order
* Returns: a 1D numpy.ndarray containing the intersection of obtaining x and n with each probability in P, respectively

### [2. Marginal Probability](https://github.com/BenDoschGit/holbertonschool-machine_learning/blob/main/math/0x07-bayesian_prob/2-marginal.py "2. Marginal Probability")

Based on 1-intersection.py, write a function def marginal(x, n, P, Pr): that calculates the marginal probability of obtaining the data:

* x is the number of patients that develop severe side effects
* n is the total number of patients observed
* P is a 1D numpy.ndarray containing the various hypothetical probabilities of patients developing severe side effects
* Pr is a 1D numpy.ndarray containing the prior beliefs about P
* If n is not a positive integer, raise a ValueError with the message n must be a positive integer
* If x is not an integer that is greater than or equal to 0, raise a ValueError with the message x must be an integer that is greater than or equal to 0
* If x is greater than n, raise a ValueError with the message x cannot be greater than n
* If P is not a 1D numpy.ndarray, raise a TypeError with the message P must be a 1D numpy.ndarray
* If Pr is not a numpy.ndarray with the same shape as P, raise a TypeError with the message Pr must be a numpy.ndarray with the same shape as P
* If any value in P or Pr is not in the range [0, 1], raise a ValueError with the message All values in {P} must be in the range [0, 1] where {P} is the incorrect variable
* If Pr does not sum to 1, raise a ValueError with the message Pr must sum to 1
* All exceptions should be raised in the above order
* Returns: the marginal probability of obtaining x and n

### [3. Posterior](https://github.com/BenDoschGit/holbertonschool-machine_learning/blob/main/math/0x07-bayesian_prob/3-posterior.py "3. Posterior")

Based on 2-marginal.py, write a function def posterior(x, n, P, Pr): that calculates the posterior probability for the various hypothetical probabilities of developing severe side effects given the data:

* x is the number of patients that develop severe side effects

### [4. Continuous Posterior](https://github.com/BenDoschGit/holbertonschool-machine_learning/blob/main/math/0x07-bayesian_prob/100-continuous.py "4. Continuous Posterior")

Based on 3-posterior.py, write a function def posterior(x, n, p1, p2): that calculates the posterior probability that the probability of developing severe side effects falls within a specific range given the data:

* x is the number of patients that develop severe side effects
* n is the total number of patients observed
* p1 is the lower bound on the range
* p2 is the upper bound on the range
* You can assume the prior beliefs of p follow a uniform distribution
* If n is not a positive integer, raise a ValueError with the message n must be a positive integer

* The only import you are allowed to use is from scipy import special
* Returns: the posterior probability that p is within the range [p1, p2] given x and n
