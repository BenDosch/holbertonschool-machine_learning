## Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

* What is a determinant? How would you calculate it?
* What is a minor, cofactor, adjugate? How would calculate them?
* What is an inverse? How would you calculate it?
* What are eigenvalues and eigenvectors? How would you calculate them?
* What is definiteness of a matrix? How would you determine a matrixâ€™s definiteness?

## Tasks
List of tasks with brief descriptions of each task.

### [0. Determinant](https://github.com/BenDoschGit/holbertonschool-machine_learning/blob/main/supervised_learning/a/0-determinant.py "0. 0. Determinant")

Write a function def determinant(matrix): that calculates the determinant of a matrix:

* matrix is a list of lists whose determinant should be calculated
* If matrix is not a list of lists, raise a TypeError with the message matrix must be a list of lists
* If matrix is not square, raise a ValueError with the message matrix must be a square matrix
* The list `[[]]` represents a 0x0 matrix
* Returns: the determinant of matrix

### [1. Minor](https://github.com/BenDoschGit/holbertonschool-machine_learning/blob/main/supervised_learning/a/1-minor.py "1. Minor")

Write a function def minor(matrix): that calculates the minor matrix of a matrix:

* matrix is a list of lists whose minor matrix should be calculated
* If matrix is not a list of lists, raise a TypeError with the message matrix must be a list of lists
* If matrix is not square or is empty, raise a ValueError with the message matrix must be a non-empty square matrix
* Returns: the minor matrix of matrix

Write a function def adjugate(matrix): that calculates the adjugate matrix of a matrix:

* matrix is a list of lists whose adjugate matrix should be calculated
* If matrix is not a list of lists, raise a TypeError with the message matrix must be a list of lists
* If matrix is not square or is empty, raise a ValueError with the message matrix must be a non-empty square matrix
Returns: the adjugate matrix of matrix

Write a function def inverse(matrix): that calculates the inverse of a matrix:

* matrix is a list of lists whose inverse should be calculated
* If matrix is not a list of lists, raise a TypeError with the message matrix must be a list of lists
* If matrix is not square or is empty, raise a ValueError with the message matrix must be a non-empty square matrix
* Returns: the inverse of matrix, or None if matrix is singular

### [5. Definiteness](https://github.com/BenDoschGit/holbertonschool-machine_learning/blob/main/supervised_learning/a/5-definiteness.py "5. Definiteness")

Write a function def definiteness(matrix): that calculates the definiteness of a matrix

* matrix is a numpy.ndarray of shape (n, n) whose definiteness should be calculated
* If matrix is not a numpy.ndarray, raise a TypeError with the message matrix must be a numpy.ndarray
* If matrix is not a valid matrix, return None
* Return: the string Positive definite, Positive semi-definite, Negative semi-definite, Negative definite, or Indefinite if the matrix is positive definite, positive semi-definite, negative semi-definite, negative definite of indefinite, respectively
* If matrix does not fit any of the above categories, return None
* You may import numpy as np
